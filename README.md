The Bootstrap Responive Portfolio is done using Bootstrap 4.3.1, CSS 3, and Html 5.

Used the <Navbar> componenet for the main Navbar, but removed the toggle effects and displayed the menu items inline, which was challenging enough for me and yes, it is not at all looking perfect when the screen size is <640px.

For contact.html, I used the <form> component which was much easier.

For portfolio.html, used the <container> component with <row> and <col>. As with the <navbar>, am not satisfied with the responsiveness when the screen size is <640px.

Though the Bootstrap makes it easy to build an app, customizing it needs a lot of patience. An analogy will be baking a cake from scratch and using a readymade cake mix!

Yes, I learnt that there is so much place for improvment and need further learning and more research.
